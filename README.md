# Pre-requisities
- Git
- Code editor (e.g Visual Studio / VSCode)
- SQL Server 2014+
- .NET 5

# Exercise Description
The following code test was created to evaluate your abilities as a .NET Developer. Some of the areas that you'll be evaluated in are:

- Creativity
- Proactivity
- Code quality
- Code organization
- Tooling choices
- Ability to follow instructions
- Attention to details

We would like you to solve each task as they appear below, and avoid doing early optimizations or refactoring unless specified or if it blocks your solution for a specific problem. If any code is copied from the internet, make sure to add a comment with a reference to where you sourced it from.

Please treat this project and the tasks below as if they were part of, or the beginning of a bigger application that you would build and support. That means, please write the code as *you* like to write it, not the way you think *we* would like you to write it.

# Getting started
1. Initialise a new git repository at the root of the folder and perform an initial commit.
2. Restore the `Backend-TakeHomeExercise.bak` backup onto a SQL Server installation. There is a single table called `Listings` that you'll work with
3. Open the `TakeHomeExcercise.sln` solution and confirm you can build and run the API. You should see "TODO" being returned from the `/listings` route.
4. Happy coding. Good luck, and have fun! :)

# How to do the exercise
As you work on each task please prefix your commit(s) message(s) with the task reference using the following pattern:

> [Task-XX] My commit message

When you complete a task, as part of your commit and changes, please change the corresponding task status below from `Pending` to `Completed` and add any comments into the designated area at the bottom of each task, where you can explain what problems you found and how you solved them. You can also explain how you'd do something more complex and/or time consuming if you had the time for it, feel free to also add any other comments that are relevant to the task.

If you have made any changes to the DB (changed schema, added indexes, foreign keys, etc), please include what you've done in the comments section of the relevant section.

An example of the expected information in a comments section could be:

```
- Code currently does XXX. A possible enhancement later could be to do ZZZ
- Wasn't sure what was intended for scenario YYY here, so i made the call to do ZZZ
```


# Tasks

---

## `Task-01`: Create an API endpoint to return paged listings

_Status: `Completed`_

Create an API endpoint that returns paged listings from the sample DB, given the following (optional) filters:

- Suburb (e.g "Southbank")
- CategoryType (e.g "Rental")
- StatusType (e.g "Current")
- Skip (e.g 0)
- Take (e.g 10)

Fields should be validated for invalid input, and the API should return an appropriate HTTP response when validation fails.

An example URL might be: `/listings?suburb=Southbank&categoryType=Rental&statusType=Current&take=10`

The returned JSON should look like:

```
{
  "items": [
    {
      "listingId": 4,
      "address": "53-55 Ellison St, Clifton Beach QLD 4879", // combination of address fields
      "categoryType": "Residential", // 1 = Residential, 2 = Rental, 3 = Land, 4 = Rural
      "statusType": "Current", // 1 = Current, 2 = Withdrawn, 3 = Sold, 4 = Leased, 5 = Off Market, 6 = Deleted
      "displayPrice": "Mid to High $800,000's",
      "title": "Buy me now!"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1212
}
```

```
Add comments here
- If I had more time, I would keep the listings table in the database as the MaterializedView add some other fields like 
- StateCode, StateId, CategoryTypeCode, CategoryTypeName, StatusTypeCode, StatusTypeName and created Non-ClusteredIndexes to speed up the search.
- The transaction tables need to be kept seperate and the listings table would get updated by adding a message in the ServiceBus to achieve Eventual Consistency.
- For now, I have just created Enumerations for CategoryType and StatusType. Depending upon the requirements and thinking that this project would grow, I would create seperate tables for them and as I mentioned I would create seperate transaction tables and seperate listing table

- If I had time, I would add another project Infrastructure.API which will have the various Extensions methods to handle resiliency, circuit breaker policies etc
- The project Infrastructure.API will basically have all the enhancements like moving the DI to Extension Methods.

- I wasn't sure of the validation messages required for the optional parameters so I added the data annotations to the RequestObject which throw error if incorrect values are being passed.

- If I had more time, I would also add Swagger to test the APIs from the browser and provide some documentation.
```

## `Task-02`: Add caching by suburb

_Status: `Partially Completed`_

A common use case for listings is returning current listings of a given type in a suburb. Because of this, we would like some basic caching adding to avoid the trip to the DB.

Please add this caching functionality, so that the following behavior occurs:
1. App loaded
2. `GET: /listings?suburb=Southbank&categoryType=Residential&take=10` -> cache MISS
2. `GET: /listings?suburb=Southbank&categoryType=Residential&take=10` -> cache HIT
3. `GET: /listings?suburb=Southbank&categoryType=Rental&take=10` -> cache MISS
4. `GET: /listings?suburb=Southbank&categoryType=Rental&take=10` -> cache HIT
5. `GET: /listings?suburb=Southbank&categoryType=Rental&take=5` -> cache HIT

```

```
- I have added the Response Cachine which caches the results for 30 seconds. 
- If I had more time, I would also add In-Memory Cache to cache the data in memory to avoid calling the DB. 
- On a production server where we can have more than 10k TPS, I would go with Redis Cache

## `Task-03`: Add a new property shortPrice

_Status: `Pending`_

We would like a new prop added to the payload:
```
{
   ... // existing props
   "shortPrice": "$800k"
}
```

This is a short version of the `displayPrice`, to be used on things like the pin display.

Minimum scenarios to handle:

| displayPrice           | shortPrice |
| ---------------------- | ---------- |
| $100                   | "$100"     |
| $100,000               | "$100k"    |
| $1,500,000             | "$1.5m"    |
| For Sale               | ""         |

Bonus points for handling other scenarios (use your judgement as to what the value should be)

## `Task-04`: Tests

_Status: `Pending`_

It is expected that you write tests for important changes you made above on the previous tasks, if any test was relevant. As a last pass, please check any code, existing or new that would benefit from tests and write them. Explain below the benefits of the tests you wrote and why they are important.
